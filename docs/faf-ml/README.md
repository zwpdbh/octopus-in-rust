# FAF-ML: Unit Detection from Game Screenshots — Handover Doc

> **Read this first when you're back.** Goal of the project: point a model at
> a Forged Alliance (FAF) screenshot and get a per-player unit breakdown
> (the "analysis" view). All code lives in the **octopus** workspace; the
> separate `dive_into_deep_learning_in_rust` workspace is the d2l.ai learning
> track (chapters 2–10 ported; chapters 11+ not started).

## The one-paragraph version of the whole approach

Manual labeling doesn't scale, so we don't do it: `faf-ml-datagen` (driven
from the server's Datagen view) pastes the
game's own strategic-icon sprites onto crops of **empty-terrain screenshots**,
which yields perfectly labeled synthetic training data for free. A small SSD
detector (`crates/faf-ml-model`) trains on that. Real **battle** screenshots
are never trained on — they're the held-out exam. If the model fails on real
screenshots, fix the *generator* (colors/scale), not the labels. Later, the
model pre-labels real shots and you correct them in the web UI — that
correction set closes the domain gap.

## What's built and verified (as of 2026-09-10)

| Piece | Where | State |
|---|---|---|
| Synthetic data generator | `crates/faf-ml-datagen` (runs as a server job; the `faf-datagen` CLI is gone) | ✅ works; tint + scale + clustering; streams samples into the store as `synthetic` screenshots with JSON labels |
| Web platform | `apps/faf-ml-server` (:3100) + `apps/faf-ml-web` + `crates/faf-ml-core` | ✅ upload (drag&drop), triage badges, label view (edit boxes), dataset snapshots, datagen jobs (`POST /api/datagen` + polling + per-job/bulk sample deletion), Units page (fafcn-web unit browser ported: `/api/units` + portraits) |
| Icon↔unit mapping | `crates/faf-unit-tools` (`icon-map` subcommand) | ✅ 114 classes ↔ 501 units; artifact at `data/faf-ml/icon-map.json`; the Units page (`/units`) is its future UI home |
| SSD detector | `crates/faf-ml-model` (model/loss/anchors/data/predict + `train.rs` event-driven loop) | ✅ implemented, 17/17 tests; `apps/faf-ml-train` CLI is DELETED — training is a server capability |
| Training monitor | `/training` page + `GET /ws/training` + `GET /api/training/status` (server `training_service.rs` driving `faf-ml-model::train`) | ✅ REAL burn training in the server: live loss/valid charts (uPlot), pause/resume/stop, server-side run registry (viewers attach/detach freely; `Attach` replays). mAP stays empty until the eval pass lands |
| MCP server | `apps/faf-ml-mcp` (rmcp, stdio) | ✅ 15 workflow-level tools (screenshots/datagen/datasets/training) — LLM agents drive the same API the web UI uses |

Not built yet: real mAP (predict+AP over the valid split), train-from-snapshot,
the eval/analysis view UI (Phase 3), Windows capture client.
See **Next tasks (priority order)** below for the full backlog.

**Design goal — one backend, two clients.** The platform exposes the same
typed JSON/WS API to everyone: humans walk the web UI's workflow (each page
shows its step banner), and LLM agents drive the identical steps through the
`faf-ml-mcp` MCP server (thin workflow-level tools; REST stays canonical).
Keep every future feature reachable from both paths.

## State at handover (evening 2026-09-10)

Today's session (all committed code, workspace compiles clean):

- **Platform UX finished**: CORS PATCH fix; label-view crash fixed (dioxus-web
  0.7.9 `WebImageEvent::as_any` bug — we read dims from metadata instead);
  datagen sliders + visual icon picker (`exclude_classes`); per-job/bulk
  synthetic deletion; kind-filtered snapshots + snapshot delete; Units browser
  + detail pages + Strategic-icons card (icon-map, nickname tooltips, shared
  icons, 4-faction filter); workflow Home + per-page step banners.
- **Real training in the backend** (the big refactor): loop moved into
  `crates/faf-ml-model/src/train.rs` (`TrainEvent` bus: Batch/EpochEnd/Done;
  `TrainControl` Continue/Pause/Abort; deterministic 10% valid split with a
  no-grad eval pass per epoch). Server: run registry + broadcast (`Attach`
  replays; disconnects never kill a run), busy guard, `GET
  /api/training/status`, `GET /api/runs`, `POST /api/predict(/annotate)`.
  MCP: `faf_ml_runs_list` + `faf_ml_predict` + status fallback to the
  registry. `apps/faf-ml-train` is deleted.

**Verified:** workspace compiles; registry plumbing live (batch-1 metrics
train=6.24 reached `GET /api/training/status` while running).
**NOT yet verified:** a full smoke run completing (epoch-end valid point,
checkpoint written, predict endpoints). It got blocked by speed, not code —
see below.

### First thing next session — finish the smoke verification

Run services in FOREGROUND terminals (user preference — no background tasks),
drive the smoke run through the platform itself (no ad-hoc scripts):

```bash
# terminal 1 (release server — debug NdArray conv is ~5 min/BATCH, unusable)
cargo run -p faf-ml-server --release
# terminal 2 (agent) or browser:
cargo xtask faf-ml mcp   # kimi with the faf-ml tools
```

Smoke run via MCP (or the Training page — same thing): `faf_ml_training_start`
with `epochs=1, max_batches=2, cpu=true` → watch `faf_ml_training_status`
until done → `faf_ml_runs_list` shows the checkpoint → `faf_ml_predict` on the
battle shot returns detections JSON. Browser equivalent: Training page Start
(epochs=1) → charts draw → status banner shows the run dir.

⚠ **Compute reality check**: this WSL box has NO real GPU — wgpu falls back
to llvmpipe (software). Real 50-epoch training should run on Windows (native
Vulkan) or a Linux box with GPU access. A full run here would take forever.

## Next tasks (priority order)

Ordered backlog. Work top-down; bump items only with a reason. When you finish
one, delete it here and update the tables/sections above to match.

### P0 — Verify the pipeline end-to-end

1. **Finish the smoke run** (`epochs=1, max_batches=2, cpu=true` via the
   Training page or `faf_ml_training_start`): epoch-end valid point appears,
   checkpoint lands in `data/faf-ml/runs/<ts>/`, `faf_ml_predict` returns
   detections on the battle shot. Then update "State at handover" above — it
   currently claims this is unverified, but a Sep-10 run dir exists; reconcile
   what actually happened.

### P1 — Make training trustworthy

2. **Seed the train/valid split** — `crates/faf-ml-model/src/train.rs:132`
   shuffles unseeded; the "deterministic 10% split" is only deterministic in
   count. Same seed → same split, or runs aren't comparable.
3. **Save the best checkpoint per epoch** (lowest valid loss), not just the
   final one — a diverging late epoch currently destroys the run's best state.
   Add early stopping and a simple LR schedule while you're in there.

### P2 — Data: close the domain gap

4. **Collect real screenshots** — only 4 background + 1 battle on disk vs. the
   ~20-across-several-maps target (step 1 below). One battle shot is not an
   exam.
5. **Calibrate `TEAM_COLORS`** in `crates/faf-ml-datagen/src/lib.rs` against
   real FAF player colors — player attribution depends on it (decision 3).
6. **Dataset compose view** (Phase 1 remainder).

### P3 — Evaluation

7. **Real mAP at epoch end** (predict + AP over the valid split) — valid loss
   alone can't tell you if detections are usable; the `map` field is stubbed
   `None` everywhere today.
8. **Phase 3 eval/analysis view** — detections → per-player unit table via
   `icon-map.json` + dominant-box-color attribution; run-registry UI in the
   monitor page; train-from-snapshot.

### P4 — Hygiene (cheap, do alongside anything above)

9. Sweep stale docs/comments: `apps/faf-ml-server/README.md` header still says
   "no training here" while documenting `/ws/training`; doc comments in
   `faf-ml-core/src/training.rs` and `lib.rs` reference the deleted
   `faf-ml-train` CLI; this doc says 193 classes but `classes.txt` has 210.
10. Delete the dead YOLO-dir loader (`faf-ml-model/src/data.rs` `load_yolo_dir`)
    — nothing writes YOLO dirs since the datagen CLI was removed.
11. Add a faf-ml section to the root `STATUS.md` — the project is invisible
    at repo level.

### P5 — Scale up (only with a real GPU)

12. **Gradient accumulation** to lift the batch-4 wgpu buffer cap, and a
    prefetched/async data pipeline (PNG decode + anchor matching currently run
    synchronously on the training thread).
13. Move a real 50-epoch run to the RTX 3090 box; consider hard-negative
    mining / focal loss if background false positives dominate on real shots.

## ▶ Your next session, step by step

```bash
cd /home/zw/code/rust_programming/octopus

# 0. Start the platform
cargo xtask faf-ml backend          # → http://localhost:3100

# 1. COLLECT: in-game (Windows), take ~20 screenshots:
#    - EMPTY terrain (zoomed-out fog areas, several DIFFERENT maps) ← for backgrounds
#    - BUSY battles (several maps)                                  ← held-out exam
#    Upload ALL via the Gallery drop zone, then triage each card:
#    "background" = empty, "battle" = has units. (Default is "unclassified";
#    the "needs triage" filter shows what's left to mark.)

# 2. GENERATE synthetic data (reads ONLY background-marked shots):
#    open the Datagen view (http://localhost:3100/datagen), set count/size/
#    scale, Generate. Samples stream into the store while the job runs;
#    the jobs table polls until done.
#    Each sample is tagged with its job id, so a bad set is removed with the
#    job row's "Delete samples" button (deletes job + its samples). Older
#    untagged sets: Gallery → "synthetic" filter → "Clear N synthetic".
#    (Jobs live in server memory — a restart wipes the jobs table, but the
#    job→sample link is persisted in index.json.)

# 3. DOMAIN-GAP CHECK (5 min, do not skip): open a synthetic sample (Gallery
#    → "synthetic" filter) next to a REAL screenshot.
#    Icons must match the real render in SIZE + COLOR + sharpness.
#    If not: tune scale-min/scale-max and TEAM_COLORS in
#    crates/faf-ml-datagen/src/lib.rs, regenerate.

# 4. TRAIN on the platform store: open the Training page (or the MCP tools)
#    and Start a run (defaults: 50 epochs, batch 4, lr 1e-3, valid 10%).
#    ⚠ UNVERIFIED END-TO-END — see "State at handover" below; run the smoke
#    test first.
#    The run lives in the server registry — you can close the page and
#    re-attach later; checkpoints land in data/faf-ml/runs/<timestamp>/
#    (model.mpk + config.json). NOTE: run the RELEASE server for real
#    training (debug conv is painfully slow) and WSL has NO real GPU
#    (llvmpipe) — use cpu:false only with a real GPU, else cpu:true.

# 5. THE MOMENT OF TRUTH — predict on a HELD-OUT battle screenshot (all API):
curl -X POST localhost:3100/api/predict -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"run":"<timestamp>","image_id":"<battle-shot-uuid>"}'
# annotated preview: same body → POST /api/predict/annotate > /tmp/pred.png
# open /tmp/pred.png: did it find the units?
```

### Reading the outcome of step 5

- **Works on real shots** → the synthetic approach is validated. Next: phase 2
  (training from the web UI) or the analysis view (detections → per-player
  table via `icon-map.json` + dominant-box-color for player attribution).
- **Works on synthetic, misses real** → domain gap. Iterate on datagen
  (colors/scale/AA), NOT on labeling by hand. Only if that stalls: mark some
  battle shots in the UI, let the model pre-label, correct, snapshot, mix into
  training.
- **Loss won't even go down on synthetic** → check anchor coverage /
  hyperparams; batch size is capped at 4 (see gotchas).

## Key decisions already made (don't re-litigate without reason)

1. **Classes = strategic icon names** (193 of them: units + markers +
   generics). Fine-grained on purpose — the analysis view aggregates via
   `faf-blueprints`. Markers/generics stay as classes so the model doesn't
   confuse them with units.
2. **Labeling UI is view+edit only** (no draw-from-scratch) — correction
   workflow, not a CVAT clone.
3. **Player attribution = dominant pixel color inside a detected box** — NOT
   an ML problem. But it means datagen's `TEAM_COLORS` must match real FAF
   player colors (currently approximate — calibrate from real screenshots).
4. **Learning workspace stays pure learning**; production model lives in
   `crates/faf-ml-model` (ch14 SSD concepts applied natively).
5. Icon-set orphans (`commander_*`, `experimental_*`, finer naval classes):
   the custom icon mod is finer than vanilla DB metadata; a curated alias
   table is a future task for the analysis view. 5 Nomads (`XNL*`) unit icons
   have no sprites — ignore unless you play with Nomads.

## Gotchas (hard-won, don't rediscover)

- **wgpu per-buffer cap ~128 MiB**: the detector's stem conv is stride-2 and
  default `--batch` is 4 because of this. Batch ≥6 panics with
  "can't allocate buffer". Fix = gradient accumulation (not implemented).
- **Train with `--release`.**
- Burn: `AdamConfig::with_grad_clipping` vs `SgdConfig::with_gradient_clipping`
  (inconsistent naming); BatchNorm/Dropout pick train/eval from
  `B::ad_enabled`, so eval needs `model.valid()` (the detector has no BN on
  purpose).
- Server on :3100; check for stale processes with `pgrep -f faf-ml-server`
  before assuming a new build is running ("Address already in use" bites).
- **No real GPU in WSL** (wgpu adapter = llvmpipe, software Vulkan): debug
  CPU conv takes minutes per batch. For real training use the RELEASE server;
  for actual speed, run where the RTX 3090 is visible.
- dx web builds go to `target/dx/faf-ml-web/{debug,release}/web/public`;
  the server serves the **release** build (`cargo xtask faf-ml build-web`).

## Reference material

- d2l.ai chapters that matter for this project: ch7 (convs), ch8 (esp. NiN's
  GAP, ResNet), ch14 (augmentation, anchors, SSD, NMS). Ports live in
  `~/code/rust_programming/dive_into_deep_learning_in_rust` with mdbook notes
  (`cargo xtask book` there).
- The icon↔blueprint reasoning: re-run
  `cargo run -p faf-unit-tools -- icon-map --out data/faf-ml/icon-map.json`.
- Platform READMEs: `apps/faf-ml-server/README.md`, `apps/faf-ml-web/README.md`.

## Phase roadmap (for orientation)

- **Phase 0 ✅** — platform: upload/triage/label/snapshot
- **Phase 1 ✅ (mostly)** — datagen is a server job driven from the web
  Datagen view; the `faf-datagen` CLI and the `/api/import/datagen` endpoint
  are gone (generation is internal, labels stream straight into the store).
  `faf_ml_model::train` reads the platform store directly.
  Remaining: dataset compose view
- **Next real milestone** — detector trained on synthetic data detecting
  units on a held-out real screenshot (steps 1–5 above)
- **Phase 2 ✅ (mostly)** — real burn training lives in the server:
  `faf-ml-model::train` (event-driven loop + validation split) driven by
  `training_service.rs`; `faf-ml-train` CLI deleted; predict is
  `POST /api/predict(/annotate)`. Remaining: real mAP at epoch end,
  train-from-snapshot, run registry UI in the monitor page
- **Phase 3** — eval/analysis view (per-player unit tables), correction loop,
  then the Windows capture client (eframe if GUI needed)
