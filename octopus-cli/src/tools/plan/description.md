Use this tool when you are in plan mode and have finished writing your plan to the plan file and are ready for user approval.

## How This Tool Works
- You should have already written your plan to the plan file specified in the plan mode reminder.
- This tool does NOT take the plan content as a parameter — it reads the plan from the file you wrote.
- The user will see the contents of your plan file when they review it.

## When to Use
Only use this tool for tasks that require planning implementation steps. For research tasks (searching files, reading code, understanding the codebase), do NOT use this tool.

## Multiple Approaches
If your plan contains multiple alternative approaches:
- Pass them via the `options` parameter so the user can choose which approach to execute.
- Each option should have a concise label and a brief description of trade-offs.
- If you recommend one option, append "(Recommended)" to its label.
- The user will see all options alongside Reject and Revise choices.
- Provide 2-3 options at most (the system appends a "Reject" option automatically, so the total shown to the user is 3-4).
- Do NOT use "Reject", "Revise", or "Approve" as option labels — these are reserved by the system.

## Before Using
- Yolo mode does not auto-approve this tool. In yolo mode, this tool still presents
  the plan to the user for approval.
- If afk mode is active, do NOT use AskUserQuestion; make the best decision from available context.
- If afk mode is active, this tool is auto-approved because no user is present.
- If afk mode is not active and you have unresolved questions, use AskUserQuestion first.
- If afk mode is not active and you have multiple approaches and haven't narrowed down yet, consider using AskUserQuestion first to let the user choose, then write a plan for the chosen approach only.
- Once your plan is finalized, use THIS tool to request approval.
- Do NOT use AskUserQuestion to ask "Is this plan OK?" or "Should I proceed?" — that is exactly what ExitPlanMode does.
- If rejected, revise based on feedback and call ExitPlanMode again.
